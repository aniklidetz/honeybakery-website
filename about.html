            <h2>The HoneyBakery Journey</h2>
            <p>HoneyBakery started from a love for baking and a deep appreciation for nature’s sweetest gifts—honey and herbs. Our journey began in a cozy kitchen, where we combined honey and hand-picked herbs to create unique and delicious treats. What started as a hobby has grown into a beloved community bakery, delighting taste buds and warming hearts with every honey-infused and herb-enhanced treat.</p>
